- /additional-services page with extras list and exclusions list
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Create Deep Cleaning and Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning pages</name>
  <files>app/deep-cleaning/page.tsx, app/move-in-move-out-cleaning/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Create app/deep-cleaning/page.tsx:
- Metadata: title "Deep Cleaning Services Las Vegas | Diamond Oasis Cleaning", description from FRAMEWORK.md
- Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Deep Cleaning
- Service schema for Deep Cleaning service
- Hero with H1 "Deep Cleaning Service"
- Intro sections from FRAMEWORK.md:
  - "A Clean Home is a Peace of Mind" (emphasize allergens, bacteria, air quality)
  - "Why Is Deep Cleaning Necessary?" (thorough vs typical, indoor air quality, extends life of furniture)
- ServiceChecklist with deep cleaning sections from FRAMEWORK.md:
  - Kitchen (10 items - includes hood, light switches, microwave interior)
  - Bathroom (5 items - includes scrubbing grout)
  - Bedrooms (6 items)
  - Living Room (5 items)
  - Laundry Room (5 items - includes lint trap)
- Additional services section (5 items)
- Bottom CTA section

2. Create app/move-in-move-out-cleaning/page.tsx:
- Metadata: title "Move-In Move-Out Cleaning Las Vegas | Diamond Oasis Cleaning"
- Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning
- Service schema for Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning service
- Hero with H1 "Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning"
- Intro sections from FRAMEWORK.md (UNIQUE content - different from deep cleaning):
  - "Make Move In or Move Out Cleaning Simple!" (security deposit, fresh start, saves time)
  - "Is Move-In/Move-Out Cleaning Necessary?" (lease requirements, peace of mind, positive impression)
- ServiceChecklist: SAME checklist as deep cleaning (per FRAMEWORK.md specification)
- Additional services section
- Bottom CTA section

IMPORTANT: Deep cleaning and move-in/move-out have similar checklists but MUST have unique:
- H1 headings (already different)
- Meta descriptions (already different)
- Intro section content (use FRAMEWORK.md content which is distinct)
This prevents duplicate content SEO issues.

URL NOTE: Use /move-in-move-out-cleaning (clean URL) not /move-in-move-out-cleaning665245 (legacy).
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` succeeds with both pages in output
- Pages accessible at /deep-cleaning and /move-in-move-out-cleaning
- Meta descriptions are unique for each page

  </verify>
  <done>

  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Additional Services page</name>
  <files>app/additional-services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create app/additional-services/page.tsx:
- Metadata: title "Additional Cleaning Services Las Vegas | Diamond Oasis Cleaning"
- Breadcrumbs: Home > Services > Additional Services
- Service schema for Additional Services
- Hero with H1 "Additional Services"
- Intro sections from FRAMEWORK.md:
  - "We offer Additional services" - ceiling fan dusting, wall cleaning, interior windows, patio dusting
  - "Additional Services are important for health" - dust, allergens, bacteria, indoor air quality
- Additional Services checklist (NOT using ServiceChecklist component - different format):
  - Simple bulleted list with CheckIcon
  - 14 items from FRAMEWORK.md: Clean Inside Oven, Clean Inside Refrigerator, Wipe Baseboards, Hand Detail Blinds, Interior Window Cleaning, Patio Furniture Dust/Wipe, Pets, Organization Services, Wall Cleaning, Baseboard Wiping, 1 Sink full of Dishes, Laundry and Folding Clothes (per load), Wipe Doors, Eco Friendly Cleaning
- Exclusion Services section (important for setting expectations):
  - Section header: "What We Don't Do" or "Service Exclusions"
  - bg-background-alt or light gray background to differentiate
  - Numbered list with XMarkIcon (from heroicons) instead of CheckIcon
  - 11 items from FRAMEWORK.md: Lifting items over 25lbs, High surfaces outside reach, Outside windows, Pet messes/heavily soiled areas, Mold/bio-hazardous material, Steam cleaning, Carpet cleaning, Deep stain removal, Landscaping/yard-work, Garages/patios (beyond sweeping), Extermination
- Bottom CTA section
  </action>

1. Build verification:
   - `npm run build` succeeds
   - Output includes: /deep-cleaning, /move-in-move-out-cleaning, /additional-services

2. Schema verification:
   - Each page contains valid Service schema JSON-LD
   - Breadcrumb schema present on all pages
   - Use Schema.org Validator (validator.schema.org) for Service schema

3. Duplicate content prevention:
   - Deep cleaning and move-in/move-out have unique H1, meta description, and intro content
   - Both share checklist (intentional - same service scope)

4. Content completeness:
   - Deep cleaning checklist matches FRAMEWORK.md
   - Move-in/move-out intro is about deposits and moving, not general cleaning
   - Additional services has both extras (14 items) and exclusions (11 items)
