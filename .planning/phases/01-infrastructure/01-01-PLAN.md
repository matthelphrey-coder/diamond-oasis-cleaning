<objective>
Initialize the Next.js 14 project with complete infrastructure including Tailwind CSS brand configuration, all data files, and root layout with analytics placeholders.

Purpose: Establish the project foundation so all subsequent phases can build components and pages on a working codebase with consistent styling and data access.

Output: A fully configured Next.js 14 project that runs locally, displays brand colors correctly, and has all data files ready for use.

  <name>Task 1: Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and App Router</name>
  <files>
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json
    - next.config.ts

    - app/globals.css
    - .gitignore

    - public/images/services/.gitkeep
    - public/robots.txt
  </files>
  <action>
  Since the project directory already exists with git initialized and FRAMEWORK.md present, initialize Next.js in place:

  1. Run `npx create-next-app@latest . --yes --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir=false --import-alias="@/*"` to initialize in current directory
     - If prompted about existing files, choose to continue (it will preserve FRAMEWORK.md and .planning/)
     - The --yes flag accepts defaults (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router)

  2. After initialization, verify the following files were created:
     - package.json (with next, react, tailwindcss dependencies)
     - tsconfig.json (with path aliases)
     - next.config.ts (Next.js configuration)
     - postcss.config.mjs (PostCSS for Tailwind)
     - app/globals.css (Tailwind directives)

  3. Create placeholder directories with .gitkeep files:
     - components/.gitkeep
     - public/images/.gitkeep
     - public/images/hero/.gitkeep
     - public/images/services/.gitkeep

  4. Create public/robots.txt with basic content:
     ```
     User-agent: *
     Allow: /

     Sitemap: https://diamondoasiscleaning.com/sitemap.xml
     ```

  5. Ensure .gitignore includes:
     - .env.local
     - node_modules
     - .next
     - out
  </action>
  <verify>
  Run `npm run dev` and confirm:
  - Server starts on localhost:3000
  - No TypeScript errors in console
  - Default Next.js page renders
  </verify>
  <done>
  Next.js 14 project initialized with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Directory structure created for components and images.

  1. Create lib/fonts.ts with Montserrat and Open Sans:
     ```typescript
     import { Montserrat, Open_Sans } from "next/font/google";

     export const montserrat = Montserrat({
       subsets: ["latin"],
       variable: "--font-heading",
       display: "swap",
     });

     export const openSans = Open_Sans({
       subsets: ["latin"],
       variable: "--font-body",
       display: "swap",
     });
     ```

  2. Update tailwind.config.ts with brand colors and fonts:
     ```typescript
     import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

     const config: Config = {
       content: [
         "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
         "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
         "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
       ],
       theme: {
         extend: {
           colors: {
             primary: {
               DEFAULT: "#1E3A5F",
               light: "#2B4F7F",
             },
             secondary: {

             accent: "#4ECDC4",
             background: {
               DEFAULT: "#FFFFFF",

             body: ["var(--font-body)", "Open Sans", "sans-serif"],
           },
         },
       },
       plugins: [],
     };
     export default config;
     ```

  3. Update app/globals.css to include base styles:
     ```css
     @tailwind base;
     @tailwind components;
     @tailwind utilities;

     body {
       @apply font-body text-text-primary;
     }

     h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
       @apply font-heading;
     }
     ```

  4. Create app/layout.tsx with fonts, metadata, and analytics placeholders:
     ```typescript
     import type { Metadata } from "next";
     import Script from "next/script";
     import { montserrat, openSans } from "@/lib/fonts";
     import "./globals.css";

     export const metadata: Metadata = {
       title: {
         default: "House Cleaning Las Vegas | Diamond Oasis Cleaning",
         template: "%s | Diamond Oasis Cleaning",

       description:

           </body>
         </html>
       );
     }
     ```

  5. Create app/page.tsx with a test page demonstrating brand colors and data import:
     ```typescript
     import locations from "@/data/locations.json";

     export default function Home() {
       return (
         <main className="min-h-screen p-8">
